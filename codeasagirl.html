    <p>Code Like A Girl is a coding course made by a company known as Vodafone whom offer a thrillingly huge chance for girls to greatly advance in their future.
This coding course offers young adoloscents who are interested in the technological side of our world a taste of what it truly feels like to work in such an advanced habitat. They provide lectures on what it is truly like behind the applications and websites we use on the daily. The girls that attended the course had the chance to create their own imagination and feel what it is like to work as someone in the Information Technology industry. During the span of four days, they have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery alongside Bootstrap and how they go from planting a simple seed and forming it into a wonderfully coded website. This offers them all a thought at what they genuinely want to become when they enter the world of working and careers. As this all comes to an end, all of those who attended can agree that it was truly a thrilling experience and that they all obtained something from it. Despite the difficulties and frustration website building brings along with it, the results after working hard and continuing to learn more are absolutely satisfying and none of them are the least bit disappointed.
We, as the girls who immediately grabbed the chance to earn more knowledge, definitely had a wonderful time here at the Vodafone headquarters and wish only the best for those who are thinking about taking the course next time or are to attend next week. This is definitely recommended for those who have a passion for Information Technology, and we all bid them good luck for their future.</p>
